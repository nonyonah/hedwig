# Smart Contract Multi-Network Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to ensure that the correct smart contracts are called for Base and Celo networks when clients pay for invoices or payment links.

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before**: The system only supported a single network (primarily Base) with hardcoded contract addresses, making it impossible to properly handle payments on different networks like Celo.

**After**: Full multi-network support with automatic network detection, correct smart contract routing, and comprehensive payment processing across Base and Celo networks.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Network Payment Service (`MultiNetworkPaymentService.ts`)

**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Simultaneous monitoring of multiple blockchain networks
- ‚úÖ Automatic network detection from contract addresses and chain IDs
- ‚úÖ Network-specific token address resolution
- ‚úÖ Concurrent payment event processing
- ‚úÖ Network-aware database updates

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Supports both Base and Celo networks simultaneously
const baseService = new HedwigPaymentService(baseContract, baseRpc);
const celoService = new HedwigPaymentService(celoContract, celoRpc);

// Automatic network detection
const network = multiNetworkPaymentService.getNetworkFromChainId(8453); // "base"
const network = multiNetworkPaymentService.getNetworkFromChainId(42220); // "celo"
```

### 2. Enhanced Payment Event Processing

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Network context included in all payment events
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint handling across networks
- ‚úÖ Network-specific token decimal handling
- ‚úÖ Chain ID tracking for all transactions

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Added network support to payment tracking
ALTER TABLE payment_events ADD COLUMN network VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE payment_events ADD COLUMN chain_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN blockchain VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE payment_links ADD COLUMN blockchain VARCHAR(50);
```

### 3. Network-Specific Configuration

**Base Network (Chain ID: 8453):**
- Contract: `HEDWIG_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_BASE`
- RPC: `BASE_RPC_URL`
- Tokens: USDC, USDT, USDbC

**Celo Network (Chain ID: 42220):**
- Contract: `HEDWIG_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_CELO`
- RPC: `CELO_RPC_URL`
- Tokens: cUSD, USDC, USDT, CELO

### 4. Smart Contract Integration Updates

**Token Address Resolution:**
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded addresses
tokenAddress = '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913'; // Base USDC only

// After: Dynamic network-aware resolution
tokenAddress = multiNetworkPaymentService.getTokenAddress(network, 'USDC');
// Returns correct address for Base or Celo automatically
```

### 5. Enhanced Payment Listener

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced single-network listener with multi-network service
- ‚úÖ Concurrent event monitoring across all networks
- ‚úÖ Network-specific error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive status monitoring

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/services/MultiNetworkPaymentService.ts` - Core multi-network service

4. `MULTI_NETWORK_PAYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
5. `src/pages/api/test-multinetwork-setup.ts` - Testing endpoint

### Files Modified:
1. `src/services/payment-listener-startup.ts` - Updated to use multi-network service
2. `src/api/actions.ts` - Enhanced token address resolution

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Variables:
```bash
# Base Network (Required)
HEDWIG_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_BASE="0xYourBaseContract"
BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
HEDWIG_PLATFORM_WALLET_BASE="0xYourBasePlatformWallet"

# Celo Network (Optional but recommended)
HEDWIG_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_CELO="0xYourCeloContract"
CELO_RPC_URL="https://forno.celo.org"
HEDWIG_PLATFORM_WALLET_CELO="0xYourCeloPlatformWallet"
```

### Backward Compatibility:
- ‚úÖ Existing single-network configurations continue to work
- ‚úÖ Fallback to original environment variables if network-specific ones aren't set
- ‚úÖ Gradual migration path to full multi-network setup

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### 1. Correct Smart Contract Routing
- **Base payments** ‚Üí Base smart contract (`0xYourBaseContract`)
- **Celo payments** ‚Üí Celo smart contract (`0xYourCeloContract`)
- **Automatic detection** ‚Üí No manual network selection required

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Users can pay from their preferred network
- Lower transaction fees on Celo for mobile users
- Broader token support across networks

### 3. Improved Reliability
