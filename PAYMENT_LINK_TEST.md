# Payment Link Creation Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Payment Link Creation Template Issue
- **Problem**: When users sent messages like "create payment link for 50 USDC", the system would return the template instead of creating the payment link
- **Root Cause**: The `handleCreatePaymentLink` function was too strict about requiring all parameters
- **Fix**: Modified the function to use sensible defaults and only show the template if absolutely no useful information was provided

### 2. Email Confusion with Send Intent
- **Problem**: When users entered email addresses during payment link creation, the system would interpret it as a crypto send transaction
- **Root Cause**: The send intent detection included email addresses in recipient extraction
- **Fix**: 
  - Modified send intent detection to exclude payment link contexts
  - Removed email pattern from crypto address extraction in send intent
  - Improved email extraction in payment link creation

### 3. Empty Handler Interception
- **Problem**: Bot integration had an empty handler for `create_payment_link` that was intercepting requests
- **Root Cause**: Empty handler in `src/modules/bot-integration.ts` was not passing through to actions.ts
- **Fix**: Modified empty handler to return false, allowing actions.ts to handle the request

## Changes Made:

### In `src/api/actions.ts` (handleCreatePaymentLink):
1. **Default Parameter Setting**: Added defaults for missing parameters:
   - Amount: Extracts from text or defaults to '50'
   - Token: Defaults to 'USDC'
   - Network: Defaults to 'base'
   - Reason: Defaults to 'Payment request'

2. **Improved Parameter Extraction**:
   - More flexible amount/token patterns including dollar signs ($100)
   - Better payment reason extraction with multiple patterns
   - Enhanced email extraction with better patterns
   - Smarter context-aware extraction

3. **Template Logic**: Only shows template if absolutely no useful information provided (text < 5 characters)

4. **Added Debugging**: Added console logs to track parameter extraction

### In `src/lib/intentParser.ts`:
1. **Send Intent Exclusions**: Added exclusions for payment link contexts in send intent detection
2. **Removed Email from Send**: Attempted to remove email pattern from crypto address extraction (multiple instances found)

### In `src/modules/bot-integration.ts`:
1. **Fixed Empty Handler**: Changed empty `create_payment_link` handler to return false, allowing actions.ts to handle

### In `src/lib/llmAgent.ts`:
1. **Updated System Prompt**: Made payment link parameter extraction more flexible
2. **Added Text Parameter**: Ensured original text is always passed for parameter extraction

## Test Cases:

### Should Work Now:
1. "create payment link for 50 USDC" → Creates payment link with extracted amount
2. "payment link $100 for consulting" → Creates payment link with dollar amount
3. "create payment link for web development" → Creates payment link with default amount
4. "payment link 25 USDC on celo for design work, send to client@example.com" → Creates payment link with email
5. "john@example.com" (during payment link creation) → Should not trigger send intent
6. "create payment link" → Creates payment link with all defaults

### Should Still Show Template:
1. "" (empty message)
2. "a" (too short, < 5 characters)

## Expected Behavior:
- Payment link creation should be much more forgiving and create links with available information
- Email addresses should not trigger send intent confusion
- Users should get actual payment links instead of templates in almost all cases
- System should use sensible defaults for missing parameters
- Better parameter extraction from natural language

## Debugging Added:
- Console logs in `handleCreatePaymentLink` to track parameter extraction
- Logs show initial params and extracted values for troubleshooting
