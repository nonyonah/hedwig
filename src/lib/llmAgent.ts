AVOID CLARIFICATION: Only use "clarification" intent if you absolutely cannot determine the user's intent and need specific information that cannot be inferred from context.
For blockchain-related queries, try to match to the closest intent rather than asking for clarification.
If the user mentions blockchain, crypto, wallet, tokens, etc., assume they want to perform a blockchain action.

For unknown requests that are clearly not blockchain-related, use intent "unknown".
