# Google Calendar Sync Requirements

## Introduction

This feature integrates Google Calendar into the existing Hedwig Telegram AI assistant, allowing users to sync invoices and due dates seamlessly. Users can connect their Google account through Telegram commands, automatically create calendar events for invoice due dates, and receive updates when invoices are paid or deleted. The integration uses Google OAuth2 for secure authentication and the Google Calendar API v3 for all calendar operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Google Calendar Authentication Setup

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want to connect my Google Calendar account through Telegram so that I can automatically sync my invoice due dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a "Connect Calendar" command THEN the system SHALL generate a Google OAuth2 authorization URL with calendar permissions
2. WHEN a user completes Google OAuth2 flow THEN the system SHALL store access_token, refresh_token, and calendar_id in Supabase linked to their Telegram ID or wallet address
3. WHEN stored tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh_token
4. WHEN a user sends a "Disconnect Calendar" command THEN the system SHALL remove all stored Google Calendar credentials and confirm disconnection
5. WHEN a user attempts calendar operations without connection THEN the system SHALL prompt them to connect their calendar first

### Requirement 2: Automatic Invoice Calendar Event Creation

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want invoice due dates automatically added to my Google Calendar so that I never miss payment deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an invoice through Telegram THEN the system SHALL automatically create a Google Calendar event using stored credentials
2. WHEN creating a calendar event THEN the system SHALL set the title as "Invoice Due – {client_name}"
3. WHEN creating a calendar event THEN the system SHALL include invoice details in description: amount, service description, and invoice_id
4. WHEN creating a calendar event THEN the system SHALL set start date/time as current timestamp and end date/time as due date
5. WHEN a calendar event is created THEN the system SHALL save the calendar_event_id to the invoice record in Supabase
6. WHEN calendar event creation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not prevent invoice creation
7. WHEN creating a calendar event THEN the system SHALL set email reminder for 1 day before and popup reminder for 1 hour before due date

### Requirement 3: Invoice Status Calendar Event Updates

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want my calendar events to reflect the current status of my invoices so that I have accurate information at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invoice is marked as paid THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event title to "✅ PAID: {client_name}"
2. WHEN an invoice is marked as paid THEN the system SHALL add "Marked as paid in Hedwig" to the event description
3. WHEN an invoice is deleted THEN the system SHALL delete the corresponding Google Calendar event
4. WHEN calendar event updates fail THEN the system SHALL log the error but not prevent invoice status changes
5. WHEN an invoice status changes THEN the system SHALL only update events for users who have connected calendars

### Requirement 4: Telegram Bot Calendar Commands

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want to manage my calendar connection through simple Telegram commands so that I can easily control the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends "/connect_calendar" command THEN the system SHALL provide a Google OAuth2 authorization link
2. WHEN a user sends "/disconnect_calendar" command THEN the system SHALL remove calendar credentials and confirm disconnection
3. WHEN a user sends "/calendar_status" command THEN the system SHALL show whether their calendar is connected and when it was last used
4. WHEN a user sends calendar commands without proper authentication THEN the system SHALL prompt them to authenticate first
5. WHEN calendar operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages through Telegram

### Requirement 5: Data Storage and Security

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want my Google Calendar credentials stored securely so that my personal data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing Google credentials THEN the system SHALL use Supabase with proper encryption for sensitive tokens
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL link them to user's Telegram ID or wallet address for identification
3. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the stored credentials with new access tokens
4. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL completely remove all stored credentials from the database
5. WHEN accessing stored credentials THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions before retrieving data

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for calendar operations so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including user context
2. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user to reconnect their calendar
3. WHEN calendar operations succeed THEN the system SHALL log success events for monitoring
4. WHEN using PostHog analytics THEN the system SHALL track events: calendar_connected, calendar_event_created, calendar_event_updated, calendar_event_deleted
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation without breaking core invoice functionality

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Invoice System

**User Story:** As a Hedwig user, I want calendar sync to work seamlessly with the existing invoice system so that there's no disruption to my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the invoice creation flow executes THEN the system SHALL check for connected calendars and create events automatically
2. WHEN invoice status changes occur THEN the system SHALL update calendar events as part of the existing status update process
3. WHEN invoices are deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up associated calendar events as part of the deletion process
4. WHEN calendar operations fail THEN the system SHALL not prevent normal invoice operations from completing
5. WHEN users don't have calendars connected THEN the system SHALL continue normal invoice operations without calendar integration
