# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the current wallet connection system from Coinbase OnchainKit/RainbowKit to Reown AppKit. The current implementation uses a combination of Coinbase OnchainKit, RainbowKit, and Wagmi for wallet connectivity, but we need to replace this with Reown AppKit for better multi-chain support and improved user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Replace Wallet Connection Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the current Coinbase OnchainKit/RainbowKit wallet connection system with Reown AppKit, so that we have better multi-chain support and a more modern wallet connection experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL use Reown AppKit instead of Coinbase OnchainKit for wallet connections
2. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL support all major wallet providers (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
3. WHEN the wallet connection is established THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work without breaking changes
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL no longer depend on @coinbase/onchainkit, @rainbow-me/rainbowkit packages for wallet connectivity

### Requirement 2: Maintain Multi-Chain Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my wallet and interact with multiple blockchain networks, so that I can make payments and transactions across different chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL support Base, Polygon,  Celo, and Lisk networks
2. WHEN a user switches networks THEN the application SHALL update accordingly and maintain functionality
3. WHEN making payments THEN the system SHALL work with the correct network and token contracts
4. WHEN displaying balances THEN the system SHALL show accurate information for the connected network

### Requirement 3: Preserve Existing Payment Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing payment features to continue working after the wallet migration, so that I can still make payments, create invoices, and use payment links without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making payments through payment links THEN the system SHALL process transactions correctly using the new wallet connection
2. WHEN paying invoices THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality and user experience
3. WHEN creating proposals THEN the payment functionality SHALL work seamlessly with the new wallet system
4. WHEN viewing transaction history THEN all data SHALL be displayed correctly regardless of the wallet connection method

### Requirement 4: Update Provider Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the provider architecture to use Reown AppKit, so that the wallet state management is consistent and reliable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL use Reown AppKit providers instead of Wagmi/RainbowKit providers
2. WHEN components need wallet information THEN they SHALL access it through the new Reown AppKit hooks and context
3. WHEN wallet state changes THEN all components SHALL receive updates through the new provider system
4. WHEN the user disconnects their wallet THEN the application SHALL handle the state change properly

### Requirement 5: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue working exactly as before, so that the wallet migration is transparent and doesn't affect my user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing wallet-dependent features THEN they SHALL function identically to the previous implementation
2. WHEN wallet addresses are displayed THEN they SHALL show the same format and information
3. WHEN transaction signing is required THEN the process SHALL work seamlessly with the new wallet connection
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback using the new wallet system

### Requirement 6: Clean Up Legacy Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused wallet-related dependencies, so that the application has a cleaner dependency tree and reduced bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN @coinbase/onchainkit SHALL be removed from wallet connection code (but may remain for other features)
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN @rainbow-me/rainbowkit SHALL be removed from dependencies
3. WHEN building the application THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized without unused wallet libraries
4. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no console warnings about deprecated wallet connection methods

### Requirement 7: Update Configuration and Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the wallet configuration to use Reown AppKit settings, so that the wallet connection is properly configured for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the wallet THEN it SHALL use Reown AppKit configuration instead of RainbowKit config
2. WHEN setting up WalletConnect THEN it SHALL use the existing NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
3. WHEN defining supported chains THEN the configuration SHALL include all currently supported networks
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the wallet configuration SHALL be properly initialized

### Requirement 8: Update Component Interfaces

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all wallet-related components to use Reown AppKit components and hooks, so that the user interface remains consistent and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying wallet connection buttons THEN they SHALL use Reown AppKit components
2. WHEN showing wallet information THEN components SHALL use Reown AppKit hooks for data
3. WHEN handling wallet events THEN the system SHALL use Reown AppKit event handlers
4. WHEN styling wallet components THEN they SHALL maintain the current design system and appearance
